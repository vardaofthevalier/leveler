Unit Tests By Package:
- cmd:
  - factory_test.go (IN PROGRESS)
  - resource_test.go (IN PROGRESS)
- config:
  - reader_test.go
- grpc:
  - server_test.go (DONE)

Integration Tests By Package:
- data:
  - redis_test.go (Sort of still a unit test, but testing doesn't make sense without Redis integration)
- leveler:
  - interface_test.go (Testing the command line interface, which will basically result in an end-to-end test of each command path)
- IDEA:
  - Some unit tests can be re-run as integration tests with Mock* types set to real things -- need to include a -mock cli argument to `go test` (DONE)

Code changes:
- implement changes to server.go to correct testing errors
