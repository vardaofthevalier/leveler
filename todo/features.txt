Data model:
- Upload contents of resources.json to Redis for schema validation on creation of new resources (leveler init schema)
	- Create requests fail if no schema is available
	- Normalization functions on schema update (may be difficult without a set of well-defined rules provided within the schema)
	- Question: can key strings contain whitespace?  If so, how can the query parser be updated to support range queries?
