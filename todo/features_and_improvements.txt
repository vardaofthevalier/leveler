Data model:
- Upload contents of resources.json to Redis for schema validation on creation of new resources (leveler init schema)
	- Create requests fail if no schema is available
	- Normalization functions on schema update (may be difficult without a set of well-defined rules provided within the schema)
	- Question: can key strings contain whitespace?  If so, how can the query parser be updated to support range queries?

CLI:
- Currently if an operation isn't supported for a particular resource type, the CLI doesn't report an error when you attempt to run the operation anyway.  It also doesn't barf when you run with the help (-h) flag.  The acceptable behavior would be to either 1) explicitly report a problem if an unsupported operation is run for a resource, or 2) print the usage info for the operation, where it should be obvious that the resources isn't supported since it won't show up in the subcommands list.
